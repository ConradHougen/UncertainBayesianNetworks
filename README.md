# UncertainBayesianNetworks
This repository contains public implementations of code for second-order learning and inference for uncertain Bayesian networks based on publications by Hougen et. al. that appeared in conference proceedings for MLSP 2021 and FUSION 2022. This repository also includes follow-up work and modifications/optimizations based on the paper code.
